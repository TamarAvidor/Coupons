in the businesses.jsp take care of the for --> iterator.




* ask if this the way to get the coupons list in JSP: 
			Object ob = request.getAttribute("coupons");
			List<Coupon> listOfBusinesses = (List<Coupon>)ob;
			 
* Getting all coupons by specific business id? can we use sql on the hibernate

* ask if we had done "many to one" good?

* should we use expression instead of out.print in JSP?

* pathStringsArray[1] --> why in the first cell why have empty string ?

* why we should have sessionID in every JSP?

* the put method on the coupnsCart class.
*update quatity for coupons?
